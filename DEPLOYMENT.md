# 🚀 Deployment Details

The SonarLabs Analytics Dashboard is deployed on **Vercel**, a cloud platform built for frontend frameworks like Next.js. Vercel streamlines the deployment process, making it exceptionally easy to launch, manage, and scale modern web applications.

## ⚡️ Continuous Deployment

- **Automatic Deploys:** Every push to the `main` branch (and any open pull request) triggers an automatic build and deployment on Vercel. This ensures that the latest changes are always live with minimal manual intervention.
- **Preview Deployments:** For every pull request or branch, Vercel creates a unique preview deployment. This allows you to test and review changes in a production-like environment before merging.
- **Production Deployments:** Once changes are merged to `main`, Vercel promotes the deployment to production automatically.

## ⏪ Rollback Support

- **Instant Rollbacks:** Vercel maintains a history of all previous deployments. If a new deployment introduces a bug or issue, you can instantly roll back to any previous version directly from the Vercel dashboard with a single click.
- **Safe Deployments:** Rollbacks are fast and do not require any manual server management, ensuring high availability and minimal downtime.

## 📊 Vercel Analytics

- **Built-in Analytics:** Vercel Analytics is enabled for this project, providing real user monitoring (RUM) and insights into site performance, traffic, and usage patterns.
- **Privacy-Friendly:** Analytics are collected without cookies or invasive tracking, respecting user privacy.
- **Performance Metrics:** Key metrics such as Core Web Vitals, page views, and geographic distribution are available in the Vercel dashboard for ongoing monitoring and optimization.

## 🛠️ Vercel Functionality & Next.js Integration

Deploying a Next.js app on Vercel is seamless and requires minimal configuration:

- **Zero-Config Deployments:** Vercel automatically detects Next.js projects and optimizes the build and deployment process without manual setup.
- **Serverless Functions:** API routes in the Next.js app are automatically deployed as serverless functions, enabling backend logic without managing servers.
- **Edge Functions:** Vercel supports deploying code at the edge for ultra-low latency, ideal for personalization and fast responses.
- **Custom Domains & HTTPS:** Easily add custom domains with automatic SSL certificates.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manage environment variables for different environments (development, preview, production) via the Vercel dashboard.
- **Instant Rollbacks & Previews:** Every deployment is immutable and can be previewed or rolled back instantly.
- **Collaboration:** Team members can view, comment, and manage deployments collaboratively.

## 🚀 Why Vercel for Next.js?

- **Optimized for Next.js:** Vercel is the creator of Next.js and provides first-class support for all its features, including SSR, ISR, static exports, and API routes.
- **Ease of Use:** Deploying is as simple as connecting your GitHub repository and clicking "Deploy"—no manual server setup required.
- **Scalability:** Vercel automatically scales your app to handle traffic spikes without any configuration.
