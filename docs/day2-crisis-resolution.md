## 🧩 3. Root Cause Analysis

**Symptoms:**

* Memory usage increased from \~50MB to 500MB+ over 15 minutes.
* Performance degraded severely on Safari and older browsers.
* CPU spikes occurred during chart updates.
* Site froze with prolonged usage due to layout thrashing.

**Key Bottlenecks Identified:**

| Source                        | Issue                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setData([...prev, newData])` | Unbounded memory growth                                  |
| `calculateComplexMetrics()`   | Massive object creation (10k+ objects per update)        |
| `generateTrendData()`         | Exponential growth with nested arrays                    |
| Chart animation               | `transform: scale()` triggered layout thrashing          |
| WebSocket + Timer             | Global `setInterval` and `window` pollution              |
| Event listeners               | Untracked `resize` listeners leaked on each site switch  |
| **UI Button Placement**       | Chart pushed down as button height changed with new data |

## 🛠️ 4. Fixes Implemented

| Fix                                                   | Description                              | Result                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ⛔ Removed deep metric generation                      | Cut large object arrays                  | 🚀 Memory usage reduced 10x |
| ✅ Bounded state arrays (`slice(-MAX)`)                | Prevented memory bloat                   | ✅ Stable memory             |
| ✅ Cleaned `resize` + `interval` handlers              | Avoided leaks on unmount                 | ✅ No listener growth        |
| ✅ Replaced chart scale pulse with class toggle        | Removed layout thrashing                 | ✅ Smooth animation          |
| ✅ Used `useMemo` for processing                       | Avoided infinite re-renders              | ✅ Stable UI                 |
| 🧹 Removed `window.dataCache` / `window.activeTimers` | Global pollution fixed                   | ✅ No global leaks           |
| ❌ Removed direct class toggle with `setTimeout`       | Prevented forced reflow                  | ✅ Better animation perf     |
| ✅ **Repositioned button outside dynamic layout flow** | Prevented chart shifting on data updates | ✅ No chart bounce/flicker   |

> 🔧 Refactored data processing logic now lives in:
> `hooks/use-data.processor.ts`

### 🚫 Why this was removed:

```ts
if (chartRef.current) {
  chartRef.current.classList.add(styles.animateChart);
  setTimeout(() => {
    chartRef.current?.classList.remove(styles.animateChart);
  }, 100);
}
```

This direct DOM mutation forced a synchronous layout recalculation and reflow, especially under frequent updates. It was replaced with a CSS-driven toggle tied to internal state.

### 🧱 Why button behavior was problematic:

A UI button positioned **above the chart** was dynamically expanding or shifting position when new data arrived, causing the chart to move. This led to **layout thrashing** and visible jitter.
**Fix:** Moved the button outside the reactive chart layout using absolute positioning or fixed-height containment.

## 🔐 5. Prevention & Monitoring Recommendations

* ✅ Set a fixed upper limit on in-memory data (e.g., 1000 entries).
* ✅ Add memory usage warnings/logs for monitoring.
* 🔍 Implement dev-only memory debug overlay using `performance.memory`.
* ✅ Track unmounted timers and listeners via `useEffect` cleanup.
* 📦 Consider offloading data processing to Web Workers.
* 📊 Integrate browser performance monitoring (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket).

---

## 🔍 6. Technical Debugging Methodology

### Tools Used:

* **Chrome DevTools** → Memory & Lighthouse Performance Tabs
* Chrome Performance Profiler Timeline
* React Developer Tools for state tracking

### Process:

1. Captured heap snapshots at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes.
2. Identified detached DOM nodes and retained arrays.
3. Filtered retained objects by constructor (e.g., `Array`, `Object`).
4. Cross-validated retained size with console-logged array lengths.

---

## ⚙️ 7. Optimization Strategy & Architecture Justification

### Strategy:

* Reduce memory footprint per data point.
* Avoid repeated processing during renders.
* Contain state growth using capped arrays.
* Remove costly unnecessary DOM manipulations.

### Key Architecture Decisions:

* Use of `useRef` to manage non-reactive timers/websockets.
* Replaced per-point heavy metric generation with shallow transform.
* Debounced chart animation with CSS classes (not JS transform).
* Real-time data handled without triggering re-renders when avoidable.
* Button repositioned outside main layout flow to avoid reflow triggers.

## ✅ 8. Enhanced Application Checklist

* [x] Memory leaks resolved.
* [x] Performance stable in Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
* [x] Chart supports 1000+ data points without degradation.
* [x] All timers/listeners cleaned up properly.
* [x] Optimized rendering and reduced chart flicker.
* [x] Processing moved outside render (via `useMemo`).
* [x] UI elements no longer cause layout shifts on updates.
* [x] Testing validated using Chrome Memory and Lighthouse tabs.
* [x] Bug-fixed version committed at `/dashboard/crisis-fix`.

## 🧪 9. Testing & Verification

* Chart responsiveness tested with live WebSocket stream.
* Simulated 15-minute run: no degradation or freezes.
* Verified React rendering behavior using DevTools Profiler.
* Confirmed consistent memory usage via Chrome Memory tab.
* Lighthouse audit confirmed optimized paint and CPU efficiency.
* Final code validated against heap snapshots and retained object inspection.
